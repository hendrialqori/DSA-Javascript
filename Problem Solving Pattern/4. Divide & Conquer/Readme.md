# Divide and Conquer Pattern

This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and repeating a process with subset of data <br/>
this pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity

## AN EXAMPLE
Given a sorted array of inetegers, write function caller search (**Binary search**), that accepts a value and returns the index where the value passed to the function is located. if the value is not found, return -1.

```
function search(sorted_array) {
    // logic here
}

search([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], 4) => 3
seach([12,14,32], 10) => -1

```

**let's jump into index file!**
